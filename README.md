# Creative-Making-MSc-Advanced-Project

Graduation Design Project - Setting Sail for Star Dreams

Creative Making - MSc Advanced Project I chose to present the final project in the form of a game, but because of the large size of the project file, it was not possible to upload it to GitHub or directly pack the zip file and upload it to moodle, so in the end, I uploaded the project file of the game to Google Drive, and you can click on the link below to jump to directly download the full file:
